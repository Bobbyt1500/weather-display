# weather-display
An always-on display that provides weather data for a selected area.

If you want to use this follow these steps:

1. Change the **OWM API KEY** on line 15 to your Open Weather Map API key
2. On line 522 Change the **INSERT_LATITUDE** to your locations latitude and the **INSERT_LONGITUDE** to your locations longitude
3. In the directory, run: ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` this will install any required python packages you do not have
4. You are good to go! Just run main.py to start the display: ```python main.py```

**Note: This is designed for a 1280x1024 display and most likely will not look good on other sizes without tweaking**
